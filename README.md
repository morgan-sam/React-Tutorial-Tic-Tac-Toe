An extension of the official React tic-tac-toe tutorial project:<br>https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Aside from the base tic tac toe game, added features include:

-Ability to specify dimension of board (i.e. 5x5 instead of standard 3x3)<br>
-Ability to specify win line length (minimum size is the same as board dimension)
